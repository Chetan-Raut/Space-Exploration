            <p>The James Webb Space Telescope is a next-generation space observatory launched in 2021. It is designed to study the universe in greater detail than ever before, with a focus on infrared observations.</p>
     
   
   
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space-based observatory that is set to be launched in 2021. It is named after James E. Webb, who served as the second administrator of NASA and played a key role in the Apollo program.</p>

    <h2>Design and Construction</h2>
<p>The JWST is a large, complex spacecraft that is designed to operate in a special orbit around the Earth, known as a Lagrange point. It is equipped with a variety of cutting-edge instruments and technologies that will allow it to observe the universe in unprecedented detail.
</p>

    <h2>Mission and Objectives</h2>
<p>The primary mission of the JWST is to study the universe in the infrared part of the spectrum, which is not visible to the human eye. It will be able to observe some of the earliest galaxies that formed after the Big Bang, study the atmospheres of exoplanets, and investigate the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies.
</p>

    <h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>The JWST is equipped with a number of advanced instruments that will allow it to make groundbreaking observations of the universe. These include a large primary mirror, which is over six times larger than the mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope, and a suite of cameras and spectrographs that can detect light from the near-infrared to the mid-infrared part of the spectrum.
</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The JWST is expected to have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Its observations could reveal new insights into the origins of the universe, the formation of galaxies and stars, and the potential for life on other planets.</p>

    <h2>Future</h2>
<p>The launch of the JWST is eagerly anticipated by astronomers and space enthusiasts around the world. Once it is operational, it is expected to remain in service for at least 10 years, providing a wealth of new data and discoveries for scientists to study and analyze.</p>
