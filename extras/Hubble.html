            <p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a large telescope orbiting Earth that has captured stunning images of the universe, allowing us to study stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects in unprecedented detail.</p>
     
   
   
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   
  <p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a large, space-based telescope that has captured some of the most stunning images of the universe ever seen. Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble has been at the forefront of astronomical research, helping scientists to study stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects in unprecedented detail.

    <h2>History</h2>
    
<p>The idea for the Hubble Space Telescope dates back to the 1940s, but it wasn't until the 1970s that the project gained momentum. The telescope was finally launched aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990, and has since been serviced and upgraded several times.</p>

    <h2>Design and Construction</h2>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a large, cylindrical telescope that is approximately 43 feet long and weighs over 24,000 pounds. It is equipped with a variety of instruments that allow it to observe the universe in different wavelengths of light, from ultraviolet to near-infrared.</p>

    <h2>Observations</h2>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has made numerous groundbreaking observations since its launch. Some of its most notable discoveries include the measurement of the expansion rate of the universe, the discovery of dark energy, and the confirmation of the existence of supermassive black holes.</p>

    <h2>Images</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most famous aspect of the Hubble Space Telescope is its stunning images of the universe. These images have captured the public imagination and have been featured in countless books, magazines, and documentaries. Some of the most iconic images captured by the Hubble include the Pillars of Creation, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Hubble Deep Field.
</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Its discoveries have led to new theories and insights into the nature of the cosmos, and have helped to inspire a new generation of scientists and researchers.
</p>

    <h2>Future</h2>
<p>Although the Hubble Space Telescope is now over 30 years old, it is still operational and continues to make groundbreaking observations. However, it is expected to be replaced in the near future by the James Webb Space Telescope, which is set to launch in 2021. The James Webb Telescope is designed to be even more powerful than the Hubble, and is expected to help us answer some of the most fundamental questions about the universe.</p>
