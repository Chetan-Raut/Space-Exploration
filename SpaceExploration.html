            <h3> Mercury</h3>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YAr4uDs.jpeg"
            alt="Clearest Image Of Mercury">
            <p>
            </p> <p>
            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and The
            closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97
            Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.
            It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury),
            god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator
            between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god
            Hermes . </p>
            <p>
            </p> <p>
            Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within
            Earth'Sun orbit as an inferior planet; its apparent distance
            from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.
            This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be
            seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern
            horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time,
            it may appear as a bright star-like object, but
            islands atmospheres difficult to observe than Venus. </p>
            <p></p>
            <h3> Venus </h3>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2flerF5.jpeg"
            alt="Clearest Image Of Venus">
            <p>
            </p> <p>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is
            sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet
            as it is almost as large and has a similar
            composition. As an interior planet to Earth,
            Venus (like Mercury) appears in Earth's sky never
            far from the Sun, either as morning star or
            evening star. Aside from the Sun and Moon,
            Venus is the brightest natural object in Earth's sky,
            capable of casting visible shadows on Earth at dark
            conditions and being visible to the naked eye in
            broad daylight. </p>
            <p></p> <p>
            Venus is the second largest terrestrial object of the
            Solar System. It has a surface gravity slightly lower
            than on Earth and has a weak induced magnetosphere.
            The atmosphere of Venus consists mainly of
            carbon dioxide, and, at the planet’s surface,
            is the densest and hottest of the atmospheres of
            the four terrestrial planets.</p>

            <h3> Earth </h3>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CjYcOrr.jpeg"
            alt="Clearest Image Of Earth">
            <p>
            </p>

           <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and home to all
            known
            life.
            While large volumes of water can be found throughout the
            Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
            Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of The
            ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers.
            The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land,
            consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface
            layer
            is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates,
            which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes,
            and earthquakes.
            Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field
            that shapes the magnetosphere of Earth,
            deflecting destructive solar winds.</p>

  <h3> Mars </h3> 
  <img 
  src="https://i.imgur.com/J6Jqq3a.jpeg"
   alt="Clearest Image Of Mars" >
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and
            the second-smallest planet in the Solar
            System, after Mercury. It is often
            referred to as the "Red Planet" because of
            its reddish appearance. Mars is a
            terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere and
            surface features similar to both the Earth
            and the Moon. It has polar ice caps,
            volcanoes, canyons, and deserts. 
        <br>
            The average distance of Mars from the Sun is about
            228 million km (142 million miles), and it takes Mars
            about 687 Earth days to orbit the Sun. Mars has two
            small natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos. The
            largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons,and
            the longest canyon, Valles Marineris, are located on
            Mars.
        <br>
            Scientists believe that Mars may have
            once had a more Earth-like environment, with liquid
            water on its surface, and that microbial life mmahave
            existed on the planet at some point.
            The  search for evidence of past or present life on
            Mars is
            a major focus of current and future Mars
            missions.

        <h3> Jupiter </h3>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/EfarSvS.jpeg"
        alt="Clearest Image Of Jupiter">

        <p>
        </p>
            <p>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the fourth
        largest in The
        Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass atmosphere
        than two and a
        half times that of all the other planets in the Solar
        System
        combined, while being slightly less than one-thousandth
        the mass
        of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural
        object in The
        Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it
        has been
        observed since prehistoric times.

        </p>

        <p>        It was named after Jupiter,

        the chief deity of ancient Roman religion

</p>
        <h3> Saturn</h3>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aj6q61v.jpeg"
        alt="Clearest Image Of Saturn">
        <p>
       
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the
        second-largest
        in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a
        gas giant with an
        average radius of about nine and a half times
        that of Earth.
        It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth,
        but is over
        95 times more massive.

        </p>

        <p> Stable feature is its prominent ring
        system, which is composed mainly of ice particles,
        with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust.
        At least 83 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which
        53 are officially named; this does not include
        the hundreds
        of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest
        moon and
        the second largest in the Solar System, is larger
        (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is
        the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial
        atmosphere. </p>

        <h3> Uranus</h3>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DG2ijkv.jpeg"
        alt="Clearest Image Of Uranus">
        <p>
        </p>
        <p> Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is named
        after Greek sky deity Uranus (Caelus), who in Greek
        mythology is the father of Cronus (Saturn),
        a grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and great-grandfather
        of Ares (Mars). Uranus has the third-largest
        planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass
        in the Solar System. The planet is similar in To
        composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical
        compositions which differ from those of the other two
        giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants).
        For this reason, scientists often distinguish Uranus
        and Neptune as "ice giants". 
        <br>
        Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system,
        a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system
        has a unique configuration because its axis of
        rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane
        of its solar orbit. Therefore, its north and
        south poles lie where most other
        planets have their equators.</p>

        <h3> Neptune </h3>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j87ambr.jpeg"
        alt="Clearest Image Of Neptune">
        <br>
        <p>
        Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the
        farthest known
        planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest
        planet in
        the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive
        planet,
        and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass
        of Earth and slightly more massive than its near-twin
        Uranus.
        Neptune its
        denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its
        greater mass causes more gravitational compression Of
        its atmosphere
        Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no
        well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun
        once
        every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1
        astronomical
        units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles).
        It is named after the Roman god of the sea and
        has the astronomical --Symbol
ψ ,
        representing Neptune's trident.


        <p>
        </p>
<p>
        Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed
        4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System
        During the first billion years of Earth's history, the
        ocean formed and then life developed within it. life
        spread
        globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and
        surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion
        years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have
        reached a population of 8 billion today. Humans depend on
        Earth's biosphere and natural resources for
        survival,
        but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment.
        <p></p>
        Today, humanity's impact on Earth's climate, soils,
        waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable, threatening
        people's lives and causing widespread extinctions of
        other life.

        <h3> Pluto</h3>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PQ1LdbZ.jpeg"
        alt="Clearest Image Of Pluto">
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
        Pluto is a dwarf planet
        in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of
        Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive
        known object to directly orbit the Sun.
        It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume,
        by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than
        Eris.
        Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily
        of
        ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets.
        Compared to Earth's moon,
        Pluto has only one sixth its mass
        and one third its volume.
